# Digital-Tumbling-E-Eye-Chart
Hi, my name is Lawson Daiki Hamasaki, the developer of this website. My objective building this is to help a brazilian nonprofit organization NGO where I'm a volunteer. The NGO is called <a href="http://abeuni.org.br/novosite/">Abeuni</a> and it provides many different health and educational services for free to people living in poverty in the city of SÃ£o Paulo (the biggest city in Brazil). And one of the health service Abeuni provides is free eye exam and glasses donation for the needed. That's why I developed this website, so that the optometrists could use it to do the eye exam.
