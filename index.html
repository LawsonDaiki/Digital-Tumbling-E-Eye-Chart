                This is a website of a digital "Tumbling E" eye chart.
                The Tumbling E chart is an eye chart that can be used to measure visual acuity. It is used by optometrist to detect farsightedness in young children who don’t yet know all letters of the alphabet. It's also a good “game” to play with a child who might be apprehensive about his or her first eye exam.
                It is also useful to test the distance visual acuity of children or adults who cannot communicate verbally due to a physical or mental disability, language barrier or other reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                These tests have no diagnostic value. In case of difficulties, only an eye care professional can carry out a complete eye examination to detect any eventual visual problems. No personal health information is collected or retained as the result of taking these tests.
            </p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                The normal  “Tumbling E” Eye Chart is print with eleven lines of block letters.
                The first line consists of one very large "E" letter (formally known as "optotypes"). Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size.
                But in this website case, it will be displayed one at a time.
            </p>
            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <h4>1. Monitor screen calibration</h4>
            <p>
                First, calibrate to the scale of the optotype to your monitor screen. Click <a href="calibration.html">here</a> to calibrate.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Distance to display</h4>
            <p>
                A person taking the test covers one eye from 6 meters or 20 feet away, and says aloud the direction where the "E" letter is pointing, beginning at the largest optoype.
                The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Controling the eye chart</h4>
            <p>
                Use the right, left arrow keys, or the left mouse button to rotate the "E". And press the up and down arrow keys, or the mouse wheel up and down to increase and decrease, respectively, the size of the optotype.
